<p>After you finish Step 2, you can skip steps 3-7.</p>

<p>Instead, you can use the tools from steps 8, 9, and 10 to rotate all the centers, move the corners around, and then rotate the corners.</p>

<p>If you take this approach, there are some new interesting situations that come up in each step.</p>

<p>For example, in step 9, the trick is to pick two opposing colors and try to sort into those first. Then you can position on each side independently. </p>

<p>The same approach works for rotating the corners.</p>

<p>At this point, I'm not sure which method is faster. Making the clover and then destroying it as you build up the bottom layer seems wasteful.</p>

<p>I've also flirted with the idea of skipping step 2 and resolving face parity issues as they come up, but I think that'll prove to be a bigger headache.</p>
